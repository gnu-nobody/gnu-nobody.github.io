<h1>Esolangs Chess Tournament</h1>

<p>
Esolangs Chess Tournament is a double round robin chess tournament hosted by gnobody and HelloBoi.
</p>

<h2>Information</h2>
<p>
	<li>You can play your games in any order you want, however it would be very good if you play both games against an opponent in one session (i.e. using the rematch button.).</li>
	<li>You  should play 2 games against each opponent, alternating colors.</li>
	<li>After you play your games, message HelloBoi or me (gnobody) on Discord to report your result. You should include links to both games in the message.</li>
        <li>You should use the account you declared in the signup form to play your games.</li>
        <li>I am not going to put the signup form on this page, as this page is public.</li>
        <li>You really shouldn't play your games before the signups are complete, as the time control will be decided only after the signups end.
        <li>If you still have questions, you can ask them to gnobody or HelloBoi on Discord.</li>
